# pseudoq

A site (https://www.pseudoq.net) featuring online playable puzzles - at the moment a few varieties of Killer Sudoku, and Hidato.  
Hopefully more will be forthcoming.

The site is developed using Typescript, React, Redux and Koa, and is deployed on Heroku, currently as a "hobby" site. 
At the moment it also uses React-Bootstrap (and therefore jquery, ...), but hopefully this dependency will be removed in 
the not-too-distant future.

I am hoping to use the site as a playground for experimenting with micropayments, to see if with enough genuinely quality content 
a site such as this might be parlayed into a meagre living.  I also intend to blog about the process, and the evolution of this
codebase on the site itself (see https://www.pseudoq.net/#/blog), as a way of motivating myself to keep going, and to provide some
much-needed focus and direction to the project.

Thanks for reading.
